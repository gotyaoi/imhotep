# The Maze of Imhotep!

The maze of imhotep is a set of exercises designed to introduce python to
someone who has not programmed before. It is structured as a series of mazes
which you must navigate using an ancient maze solving machine you discover near
the entrance. Luckily, this machine is programmed with python, so you may just
have a chance. Can you find your way out?

## Requirements

You need python 3.4 or greater. Additionally, you need a compatible tcl/tk
install. On windows this should be bundled with python. On Linux, your package
manager should have installed these as a dependency of python, but check just in
case. On OSX, you should be ok, but if you run into graphical issues, please see
[this python.org page](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/).
