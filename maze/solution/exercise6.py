# In this exercise don't worry about this line for now.

    # In python being indented like this is called being inside a block. Make
    # sure anything you write in this exercise is indented by 4 spaces.

    # In this exercise, one of the walls next to the exit is openable, but
    # which one it is is randomized each time you run the exercise. Luckily,
    # there's a way to tell if a wall opened when you call open_sesame.

    # Functions and methods have what's called a return value. This is data that
    # is passed back out of the function when it ends. In the case of
    # open_sesame, it passes back a list of directions that were opened, like:
    # ['north', 'west']. You can store this return value in a variable to use
    # later(see exercise1). So, how do we check it?

    # You can use an if statement to check whether things are True or False. In
    # the case of lists, a list with anything in it is True, while an empty list
    # is False. An if statement looks like this:

    # if somevariable:
    #     do_some_stuff()
    # else:
    #     other_stuff()

    # note that the statement inside the if is indented. The block inside the if
    # is only run if the thing the if is checking is True. The else statement is
    # run when the thing the if is checking is False.

    # So, how can you use an if statement to find the openable wall and get to
    # the exit.
    pass
