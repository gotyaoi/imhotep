# In python, a number on it's own like 3, is called an int, short for integer.
# ints can represent any non-fractional, rational number, including negative
# numbers, positive numbers and zero.

# You can now use ints in the instruction list to repeat the following
# instruction the specified number of times. The int is an element of the list
# the same as the strings you've been using so far. For example, a list that
# previously looked like this:
# ['west', 'west', 'west', 'west']
# Could now look like this:
# [4, 'west']

# Make sure you don't quote the numbers in the instruction list! If you did,
# they would be strings, not numbers. Don't forget that all elements of a list
# must be separated by commas.
instructions = []
