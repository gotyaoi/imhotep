# You can now use numbers in the instruction list to repeat the following
# instruction the specified number of times.

# In python, a number on it's own like 3, is called an int, short for integer.
# ints can represent any non-fractional, rational number, including negative
# numbers, positive numbers and zero. Make sure you don't quote the numbers in
# the instruction list! If you did, they would be strings, not numbers.

# Don't forget that all elements of a list must be separated by commas.
