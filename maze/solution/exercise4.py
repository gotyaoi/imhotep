    # A function in python is a way to associate a couple of lines of code with
    # a name. By writing the name followed by (), you can run the code asociated
    # with the name. For example, if you had a function named mansplain, you
    # could run, or "call", the function by writing "mansplain()", and it would
    # then mansplain at you.

    # Functions can also take in data when you call them. data passed to a
    # function is called the functions arguments, and is usually used to
    # influence what the function does. For example, mansplain might take an
    # argument that tells it what to mansplain about. You pass arguments like
    # this: "mansplain('basic math')".

    # In previous exercises, you wrote a list of instructions, and we took care
    # of running them for you. Time to do a little more work. Inside this block,
    # you have access to a function called run. run takes one argument, which is
    # the instruction lists we have been having you write. In this exercise,
    # fill out the instruction list as normal, but then call the run function
    # with your instructions.
    instructions = []
