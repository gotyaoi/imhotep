# For reference, [] defines what in python is called a list. It is a container
# for holding other things. All elements of a list must be separated by commas.

# Anything between quotes is called a string, and is how we represent text in
# python.

# You can input instructions for the machine here. Instructions must be quoted
# strings as described above. Allowable instructions are absolute directions:
# 'north', 'east', 'south' or 'west'.
