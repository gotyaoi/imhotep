# For reference, [] defines what in python is called a list. It is a container
# for holding other things. Anything between quotes is called a string, and is
# how we represent text in python.

# You can input instructions for the machine here, separated by commas.
# Directions must be quoted strings as described above. Allowable directions
# are either absolute: 'north', 'east', 'south', 'west' or relative to which
# way we are currently facing: 'forward', 'right', 'backward', 'left'.
