# For reference, [] defines what in python is called a list. It is a container
# for holding other things. Anything between quotes is called a string, and is
# how we represent text in python. You can see a different type of string at the
# top of this file. A whole number like 3 is called int, short for integer.

# You can input instructions for the machine here, separated by commas.
# Directions must be quoted strings as described above: 'north', 'forward',
# while numbers, or ints, do not: 3.
