# for holding other things. Anything between quotes is called a string, and is
# how we represent text in python.

# You can input instructions for the machine here, separated by commas.
# Directions must be quoted strings as described above. Allowable directions
# are absolute: 'north', 'east', 'south' or 'west'.
