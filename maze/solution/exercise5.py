# In this exercise don't worry about this line for now.
def hand(walker):
    # In python being indented like this is called being inside a block. Make
    # sure anything you write in this exercise is indented by 4 spaces.

    # Inside this block, instead of having the run function, you have an object
    # called walker, representing the maze walking machine. An object is simply
    # a container which holds both data and functions that operate on that data.
    # A function that lives in an object is called a method of that object. The
    # run function from last exercise was actually a method of the walker
    # object. To call a method of an object, you can write
    # "objectname.methodname()".

    # Aside from the run method, the walker object also has an open_sesame
    # method. This method takes no arguments, and will open certain walls in the
    # maze when the machine is next to them. For this maze, the wall to the
    # south of the exit can be opened.

    # pass simply means that there's nothing here at the moment. Delete the pass
    # and replace it with your own code.
    pass
